A fairly basic chat app. Includes channels, and exercises various holochain features including signals.

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

- Build the Holochain tools
  - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/holochain && cd ./holochain`
  - Activate the needed rust environment and load correct holochain version: `nix-shell`
- Build the elemental-chat DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):
  - Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat && cd ./elemental-chat`
  - Build the wasm: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - Assemble the DNA: `hc dna pack . -o elemental-chat.dna`
  - Assemble the hApp: `hc app pack . -o elemental-chat.happ`

## Running

```bash
cd elemental-chat/tests
npm install
npm test
```

> `npm test` will also run the build and assemble commands for you.
